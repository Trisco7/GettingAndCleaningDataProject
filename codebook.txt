NOTE: Rest all variables are features normalized and bounded within [-1,1].

The features selected come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ 
(prefix 't' to denote time domain signals). 
The acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ).

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain 
Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ).
Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm 
(tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing 
fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. 
(Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

The set of variables that were estimated from these signals and used in tidy dataset are:
mean(): Mean value
std(): Standard deviation

In tidy dataset, each below variable represents the average of each variable (explained above) for each activity 
and each subject.
